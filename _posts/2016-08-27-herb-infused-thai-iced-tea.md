### Thai Iced Tea

_Serves 6_

6 chai tea bags, or 6 black tea bags with ½ teaspoon of ground cinnamon, two cardamom pods, 1 star anise and ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

8 cups boiling water

¼ to ½ cup granulated sugar, optional

1 can condensed milk (14 ounces)

3-5 tablespoons melted[cannabutter][0]

**Directions**

1\. Place the chai tea bags (or the black tea bags with the spices) in a pitcher. Pour 8 cups of boiling water over the tea bags. Allow to steep for 4-5 minutes. Remove the bags and add the optional sugar. Let cool to room temperature.

2\. In a small bowl combine the condensed milk and melted cannabutter.

3\. Fill 6 glasses with ice cubes. Fill each glass two-thirds of the way with the tea. Top the tea with about 2 ounces of the condensed milk mixture. It will sink to the bottom, and that's good. Stir and drink. So, so good.
